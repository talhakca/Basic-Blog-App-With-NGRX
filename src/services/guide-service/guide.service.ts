      content: `From the outset, the child or adolescent with diabetes and relevant family members should receive care from a multidisciplinary diabetes team comprised of specialists with training and expertise in both dia- betes and pediatrics, and knowledgeable of child and adolescent development (E). The diabetes care team should emphasize that the family and child are the central members of the care team (E). Clear and consistent communication around education and the treatment plan is essential. The treatment plan should integrate current technol- ogies commensurate with available resources and the individual child's/family's needs. (E) A multidisciplinary team is unlikely to be available in areas of low population density and where childhood dia- betes rarely occurs.`
